AssetLibraryMultiselect
=======================

A media browser for ALAssetLibrary (iOS's photo library).  Built on top of UICollectionView and nimbus's PagingScrollView, photo, and cache classes.  Supports selecting multiple items, provisioning for long pressing items, and video playback.

This is old code and may be useful to illustrate ALAssetLibrary access.  Otherwise I would not recommend using it any sort of production deployment.

To fetch dependencies run from the root project directory:
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
